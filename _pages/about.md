# About Grove

## What is Grove?

Grove is a UI toolkit, providing reusable and interoperable resources for developers who are assembling visually-rich applications backed by MarkLogic. Grove aims to simplify the development of extensible middle-tier and front-ends, to enable a consistent developer experience across projects, to promote reuse, and to support up-to-date standards, tools and best practices.

The Grove architecture is designed to support developers in their primary ecosystem: currently Node or Java in the middle-tier and React or Vue on the front-end. To achieve this, Grove defines an API for all core communication between a Grove middle-tier and a Grove front-end. This allows swapping: as requirements change, you can switch out your Node middle-tier for one written in Java, for example. 

Grove is also modular and pluggable, so that you can install existing plugins required by your project, while sharing new functionality that you create with others.

## How Do I Get Started?

Grove provides a command-line interface (the grove-cli) to bootstrap new projects and configure existing ones. See the **[Getting Started Guide](/grove/guides/getting-started/)** for instructions on creating and configuring a new project.
